# Sound Royale - Engineering Notes & Business Reasoning

## Project Vision & Business Case

### Why Sound Royale?
**Problem Statement:** Music producers lack competitive platforms to showcase skills and get real-time feedback from communities.

**Market Opportunity:**
- Discord music communities: 50M+ active users
- Beat-making tools adoption growing 25% yearly
- Competitive gaming mechanics proven successful (Fortnite, chess.com)
- Gap: No real-time music battle platforms with community voting

**Business Model:**
- Freemium: Basic matches free, premium features paid
- In-game currency (coins) for cosmetics and advantages
- Creator partnerships and sponsored events
- Potential label scouting opportunities

### Target Users
1. **Primary:** Aspiring producers (16-25) seeking recognition
2. **Secondary:** Music enthusiasts wanting to discover new talent
3. **Tertiary:** Labels/A&Rs looking for emerging artists

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Frontend: React + Vite
**Why chosen:**
- Fast development with modern tooling
- Strong ecosystem for real-time features
- Easy deployment to Vercel (free tier)
- Component reusability for complex game UI

**Business reasoning:**
- Rapid prototyping = faster market validation
- Low operational costs during growth phase
- Developer familiarity = lower hiring costs

### Backend: Supabase
**Why chosen:**
- PostgreSQL reliability for complex game state
- Built-in real-time subscriptions for multiplayer
- Auth + Storage + Database in one platform
- Generous free tier delays infrastructure costs

**Business reasoning:**
- $0 infrastructure cost until significant scale
- Real-time capabilities critical for engagement
- Reduces time-to-market vs custom backend

### Discord Integration Strategy
**Why Discord-first:**
- Music communities already exist there
- Built-in voice channels for live performance
- Viral growth through server sharing
- No need to rebuild social features

**Business reasoning:**
- Leverage existing user habits
- Faster user acquisition through community integration
- Lower marketing costs (organic growth)

## Game Design Philosophy

### ELO System Design
**Decision:** Separate competitor/spectator ELO ratings

**Engineering reasoning:**
- Different skill sets (creating vs judging music)
- Prevents gaming through alt accounts
- Allows specialization paths

**Business reasoning:**
- More engagement touchpoints (two progression systems)
- Better match quality through skill-based matching
- Monetization opportunities (ELO boosts, coaching)

### Weighted Voting System
**Decision:** Spectator ELO determines vote power (1.0x to 2.5x)

**Engineering reasoning:**
- Prevents vote manipulation by new accounts
- Quality control on judging
- Encourages spectator skill development

**Business reasoning:**
- Maintains competitive integrity (trust)
- Creates incentive for spectator participation
- Premium feature potential (vote multipliers)

### 5-Minute Genre Calling + 30-Minute Production
**Decision:** Fixed time constraints with potential handicaps

**Engineering reasoning:**
- Prevents infinite games
- Creates urgency/excitement
- Simplifies server resource management

**Business reasoning:**
- Predictable session length = better scheduling
- Creates highlight moments for social sharing
- Enables tournament formats

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Current)
**Goal:** Validate core gameplay loop
- Basic game mechanics working
- Simple Discord integration
- Mock data simulation

**Business priority:** Learn if people enjoy the core concept

### Phase 2: Audio Integration (Next)
**Goal:** Real music creation and voting
- Audio upload/playback system
- Quality control mechanisms
- Basic user accounts

**Business priority:** Validate that people will create/judge real music

### Phase 3: Real-time Multiplayer
**Goal:** Live competitive experience
- WebSocket synchronization
- Live spectator counts
- Real-time voting progress

**Business priority:** Create addictive, social experience

### Phase 4: Community Features
**Goal:** Self-sustaining user growth
- Leaderboards and rankings
- Tournament organization
- Creator spotlights

**Business priority:** Achieve product-market fit

## Key Engineering Principles

### 1. Progressive Enhancement
Start with basic functionality, layer on complexity
- **Why:** Faster iteration cycles
- **Business impact:** Earlier user feedback, reduced development risk

### 2. Real-time First
Design all features with live updates in mind
- **Why:** Creates engaging, social experience
- **Business impact:** Higher user retention, viral sharing potential

### 3. Mobile-Responsive from Day 1
Discord mobile usage is 60%+ of total
- **Why:** Accessibility drives adoption
- **Business impact:** Larger addressable market

### 4. Audio Quality Standards
Enforce minimum audio standards for submissions
- **Why:** Platform credibility and user experience
- **Business impact:** Attracts serious creators, enables partnerships

## Technology Stack Rationale

### Real-time Architecture
```
Discord Bot (Replit) ↔ Supabase ↔ Web App (Vercel)
```

**Why this approach:**
- Cost-effective scaling (all free tiers initially)
- Each service handles what it does best
- Easy to swap components if needed

### Audio Strategy
**Initial:** Supabase Storage for user uploads
**Future:** Integrate with SoundCloud/Spotify APIs for metadata

**Why:** Start simple, add complexity when proven valuable

### State Management
**React Query + Supabase real-time subscriptions**

**Why:** Optimistic updates + real-time sync = best UX

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **Audio quality/size issues**
   - Solution: Implement compression and validation
   - Timeline: Phase 2 development

2. **Real-time synchronization complexity**
   - Solution: Start with polling, upgrade to WebSockets
   - Timeline: Phase 3 development

3. **Discord rate limiting**
   - Solution: Implement queuing and backoff
   - Timeline: Monitor during Phase 1

### Business Risks
1. **Music copyright concerns**
   - Solution: Original beats only, clear terms of service
   - Timeline: Legal review before public launch

2. **User acquisition challenges**
   - Solution: Partner with existing Discord music servers
   - Timeline: Ongoing community outreach

3. **Monetization difficulties**
   - Solution: Focus on engagement first, revenue later
   - Timeline: Post product-market fit

## Success Metrics & KPIs

### Technical Metrics
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- Real-time sync latency < 500ms
- 99% uptime for Discord bot
- Audio upload success rate > 95%

### Business Metrics
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
