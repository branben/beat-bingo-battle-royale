# 🎉 Phase 1B Infrastructure Setup - COMPLETE!

## ✅ What We've Built

### 1. **Complete Supabase Database Schema**
- **Users table**: Discord OAuth profiles, ELO ratings, game stats
- **Matches table**: Real-time game state with JSON bingo cards
- **Audio submissions table**: Beat uploads with metadata
- **Votes table**: Weighted voting system with ELO snapshots
- **Leaderboards**: Pre-built views for competitor and spectator rankings
- **Row Level Security**: Proper access controls for all data

### 2. **Discord OAuth Authentication**
- **AuthService**: Complete authentication wrapper
- **AuthCallback page**: Handles OAuth redirect flow
- **User profile creation**: Automatic Discord profile import
- **Guest mode**: Fallback for non-Discord users
- **Session persistence**: Maintains login state across visits

### 3. **Audio Storage Infrastructure**
- **Supabase Storage bucket**: Secure audio file storage
- **Access policies**: User-scoped file upload/access
- **Metadata tracking**: File size, duration, processing status

### 4. **Enhanced Landing Page**
- **Discord Connect**: One-click OAuth login
- **Guest Mode**: Play without account creation
- **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile

## 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Configure Supabase (5 minutes)
1. Create Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Run the SQL migration: `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
3. Enable Discord OAuth provider in Authentication settings
4. Copy environment variables to `.env.local`

### Step 2: Set up Discord Applications (10 minutes)
**For Web App OAuth:**
1. Create Discord app for authentication
2. Add OAuth redirect: `https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
3. Copy Client ID to environment variables

**For Discord Bot:**
1. Create second Discord app for the bot
2. Add bot user with slash commands
3. Copy bot token and IDs

### Step 3: Deploy Infrastructure (15 minutes)
1. **Web App**: Deploy to Vercel (connects to Supabase)
2. **Discord Bot**: Deploy to Replit (connects to web app via Supabase)
3. Test the full flow: Discord login → web game → bot commands

## 🔄 How the Full System Works

```
Discord User → OAuth Login → Supabase → Web App Game
     ↓                                        ↑
Discord Bot ← Slash Commands ← Game State ←----
```

### User Journey
1. **Discord Login**: User authenticates via Discord OAuth
2. **Profile Creation**: Supabase creates user profile with ELO ratings
3. **Game Participation**: Join matches, submit beats, vote on rounds
4. **Discord Integration**: Use bot commands for stats, leaderboards
5. **Persistent Progress**: ELO and stats saved across sessions

### Data Flow
- **Web App**: Manages game UI, audio uploads, real-time voting
- **Supabase**: Stores all game data, handles authentication, audio storage
- **Discord Bot**: Provides commands, tournament features, community integration
